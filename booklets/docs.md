# ASTRAL Booklets

## Introduction

We humans live on a planet called Earth, which you might already know is orbiting our Sun. But the Sun is just one star among millions, stars of all different sizes and colours. Stars which explode spectacularly or fade quietly, surrounded by planets, or in a system with another star. Stars which are all grouped together in an object billions of billions of kilometres across. We call this object the Milky Way.  This booklet will take you on a journey through it, seeing all the different types of stars it is home to along the way.
